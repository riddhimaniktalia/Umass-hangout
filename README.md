# UMass Hangout

## Introduction
Students often struggle to make meaningful connections and find peers with shared interests, leading to feelings of isolation. The UMass Hangout application addresses this by enabling students to create or join interest-based groups, facilitating flexible social interactions and real- time communication for organizing activities. The objective of the UMass Hangout web application is to create a
platform that facilitates student interactions, encourages group activities, and enhances the overall campus experience. By connecting students with shared interests and availability, UMass Hangout aims to  foster a sense of community and belonging among UMass students.
